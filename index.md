## Alisha Gupta

I am a junior at the Academy for Mathematics, Science, and Engineering. I am interested in both quantum electromagentism and the uses of topology in condensend matter research. I also enjoy studying pure mathematics, at the moment I am interested in researching the volume conjecture (an open problem in knot theory).

### -Physics Things
#### --What I am Doing:
At the moment I am focused on learning quantum mechanics reigourusly and I plan on getting to a point where I can research further condensed matter specifically how topological invariants play a major role in studying the symmetries of many quantumn systems. In the past I have spent my time learning electrodynamics (Griffiths) and have exposure with classical mechanics (Taylor). More of my previous physics endeavours on my CV found below!

### -Math Things
#### --What I am Doing:
Right now I am focused on solidfying my knowledge of knot theory and make the break into more advanced knot theory. I am readily trying to research the volume conjecture and other fascinating subsets of knot theory such as hyperbolic knot theory. Other than that, recently I have also been fascinated by representation theory and have started to learn some of it.

### Other Interests
When I am not engaged in maths and physics, I am often speaking to people about philosphy, history, social sciences, and/or going to various locations in and outside of New Jersey (Morris County!!!!). Recently, I have started to go to New York City quite often with my friends some such activities captured below. Other than that I also thourughly enjoy jazz music and actually would reccomend going to the Village Vanguard (jazz club) in the city if given a chance.
