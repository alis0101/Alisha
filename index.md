## Alisha Gupta

I am a junior at the Academy for Mathematics, Science, and Engineering. I am interested in both quantum electromagentism and the uses of topology in condensend matter research. I also enjoy studying pure mathematics, at the moment I am interested in researching the volume conjecture (an open problem in knot theory). More of my previous mathematical and physics endeavours can be found below. 

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/alis0101/alishag.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
