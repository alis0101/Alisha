## Alisha Gupta

I am a junior at the Academy for Mathematics, Science, and Engineering. I am interested in both quantum electromagentism and the uses of topology in condensend matter research. I also enjoy studying pure mathematics, at the moment I am interested in researching the volume conjecture (an open problem in knot theory).

#### What I am Doing:
At the moment I am focused on learning quantum mechanics reigourusly and I plan on getting to a point where I can research further condensed matter specifically how topological invariants play a major role in studying the symmetries of many quantumn systems. In the past I have spent my time learning electrodynamics (Griffiths) and have exposure with classical mechanics (Taylor). More of my previous physics endeavours on my CV found below! 
#### What I am Reading:
### Math Things
#### What I am Doig:
Right now I am focused on solidfying my knowledge of knot theory and make the break into more advanced knot theory. I am readily trying to research the volume conjecture and other fascinating subsets of knot theory such as hyperbolic knot theory. Other than that, recently I have also been fascinated by representation theory and have started to learn some of it.
