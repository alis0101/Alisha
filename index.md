## Alisha Gupta

I am a junior at the Academy for Mathematics, Science, and Engineering. I am interested in both quantum electromagentism and the uses of topology in condensend matter research. I also enjoy studying pure mathematics, at the moment I am interested in researching the volume conjecture (an open problem in knot theory). More of my previous mathematical and physics endeavours can be found below.

### Physics Things
At the moment I am focused on learning quantum mechanics reigourusly and I plan on getting to a point where I can research further condensed matter speicfically
